# login-ng
A greeter with the additional (and totally optional) feature of shielding the real password
behind another password that can be unlocked by various means while logging in:
    - __autologin__: provide autologin functionality that has been long lost in systemd-homed
    - __secondary password(s)__: allow the use of one or more secondary passwords
    - __controllers__: enter a password via a gaming controller
    - __fingerprint__: no password required: login via fingerprint
    - __files__ use a specific file on some kind of removable media to authenticate
    - __pin__ a numeric pin just as in your phone

By default login-ng will behave exactly as any other greeter: you type your password to access your account.

Using *login-ng_ctl* utility you can set more authentication options or even configure autologin for a systemd-homed
account with an encrypted home directory.

## Additional authentication
Additional authentication methods is a feature introduced to support more secondary authentication methods regardless
of pam configuration and usage of systemd-homed.

In the spirit of maintaining the account self-contained settings will be stored as *xattrs* on the home directory:
what systemd-homed does to store certain things, but this also means that such feature is not usable on home directories stored
in filesystems that do not support extended attributes, such as cercain network filesystems, ntfs (oh god, please don't.) and others.

## Security considerations
When *additional authentication methods* feature is not in use the security of this greeter shold not be different than any other greeter,
however when such feature is used there are additional considerations: __read below__.

__Disclaimer__: Despite me attempting to provide something that is at least as secure as the secondary authentication method used
(because if you set an empty password that will nullify the security of home encryption) and no more secure than the
main account password, this software is very new and born out of a necessity of mine, with my usecase in mind
and only my own experience to back up security.

With the above in mind it's firstly necessary to address the elefant in the room:
I have avoided what I was aware of in terms of attacks to encryption and tried to stick with audited rust crates, or well-known ones:
aes_gcm has received a security audit, and this software actively avoids to reuse the same (nonce, password) tuple, however if
adding and removing secondary authentication methods up to the point of collisions of randomly-generated nonce (96bits) data being a possibility
then this software is not suitable!

In addition to the above warning the user must know that using the additional authentication features will
require the user to have an intermediate key that cannot be changed unless every data associated with this software is removed for
the specific user; that intermediate key is used to decrypt the user main password, therefore in case such intermediate key is disclosed
changing the main password won't suffice!

The good part is that knowing the main password will __NOT__ disclose the intermediate key nor any secondary authentication method,
and knowing the intermediate key will __NOT__ disclose secondary authentication methods.
